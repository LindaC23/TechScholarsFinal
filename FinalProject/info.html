   <p class = "body1">Sally Hemings was born in 1773 to Elizabeth Hemings, an enslaved woman, and John Wayles, a white slave owner. Her mother was also the daughter of a white man and enslaved woman. Thus, Sally Hemings was three-quarters white; although there are no known images of her, she was described to have long straight hair and light-colored skin. Despite having a white father, she inherited her mother’s enslaved status. as determined by Virginian law. A notable fact about her ancestry is that she shared a father with Martha Jefferson, who was Thomas Jefferson’s wife.

 <p class = "body2">After the death of Wayles, Sally Hemings and her family were inherited by Martha Jefferson. At a young age, Sally Hemings acted as the nursemaid of Maria Jefferson, Jefferson's daughter. When Sally Hemings was just 14 years old, she accompanied Maria Jefferson to Paris in order to serve as a domestic servant for the Jeffersons. It is widely believed that her sexual relationship with Thomas Jefferson began sometime during her two year stay in France. It is uncertain how she felt towards the relationship, but it is undeniable that she did not have a choice; enslaved women did not have legal rights to reject undesired sexual advances. In 1789, Thomas Jefferson began preparing to leave France. It is important to note that in France, Sally Hemings had the ability to gain legal freedom; she did not have legal obligations to return to Monticello. However, she negotiated with Jefferson. She refused to return to Monticello unless Jefferson granted her “extraordinary privileges” and freedom for her future children.  Since he agreed, she did return to Monticello.

   <p class = "body3">When she returned to Monticello, she continued serving as a household servant. Sally Hemings ended up having six children with Jefferson, four of which survived to adulthood and were freed. Although Sally never obtained legal freedom herself, Martha Jefferson, Thomas’s daughter, granted her permission to leave the plantation with her younger sons, Madison and Eston.
